# Maynooth CarPool
A car sharing Web Application for Students and Staff of Maynooth University.
<!-- slide -->
###  Chapter 1 Introduction
<span style="font-size: 30px;"> A key goal of Campus Travel and Traffic Management in Maynooth University is to seek a reduction in demand for on-campus parking by obtaining a reduction in the level of single occupant car journeys.
Research on carpooling/car sharing was done as well as correspondence with the Maynooth Campus Travel and Campus management to gather information on numbers travelling to and from the University daily. upon completion of research an approach strategy was formed and implemented for this project.</span>

### Chapter 2 Technical Background
<span style="font-size: 30px;">
This project is an application using HTML, CSS and Typescript languages for creating the web pages.
Ionic is the open source SDK for hybrid mobile app development built on top of Angular JS and powered by Cordova. Node.js was also installed. NPM is the package manager for Node.js that allows us to download free packages which contains the files for modules that are used.</span>

### Chapter 3 The Problem
<span style="font-size: 30px;">
 To get a good idea what this web application required was a very important part of this project. Analysing the users needs and feelings was carried out in the form of Context Mapping and User Personas. Main requirements addressed in this project were</span>

     1. Create a Register page
     2. Create a Login page
     3. Create a Homepage
     4. Create a Map page

### Chapter 4 The Solution    
<span style="font-size: 30px;">
 The project was developed using the waterfall approach methodology. The system architecture used for developing this application on the client side was the Ionic Framework as the SDK, AngularJS framework for the front-end and Cordova framework for the cross-platform development. The AngularJS Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern was followed. The matching algorithm was also addressed in this chapter of the report.

### Chapter 5 Evaluation
<span style="font-size: 30px;">
Unit testing was used throughout this project from start to finish. This testing approach was ideal for
testing small to medium individual pieces of code. Usability testing allowed to test the application for ease of use, can a user use
this application to achieve the specific goal of carpooling with other likeminded individuals. The results from these tests show that the
application performed as intended and yet some improvements and functionality can be added in future work.

### Chapter 6 Conclusion
<span style="font-size: 30px;">
This project was able to achieve creating an online web application that allows users to partake in the
event of carpooling/car sharing. This application was a prototype and was able to provide an acceptable level of performance to achieve
this. Suggested steps for future work on the Matching algorithm were added in this chapter.
