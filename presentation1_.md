### Chapter 3 The Problem

<span style="font-size: 30px;">
To get a good idea what this web application required was a very important part of this project. Analysing the users needs and feelings was carried out in the form of Context Mapping and User Personas. Main requirements addressed in this project were
   ## *Create a Register page that allows the user to create a First name,   Surname and Username.
         * Allow the user to Login to the Homepage of the CarPool application.
         * Allow the user to access the Find Match function on the Homepage which brings the user to the Map page upon where the user enters the destination and appropriate matches are found.</span>
